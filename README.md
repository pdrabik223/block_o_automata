# block_o_automata
My* version of a automata game 

## the origin of the idea
So long time ago I 've seen a video of a guy writing game for some king of game jam,
anyway so he did an automata game that player sets up blocks, and then he presses start and the game plays itself

kinda cool 

the guy made it in c# using unity
I'll try to find the original and link it below

##my approach

I'll try to recreate the idea  on my own

<ol>
<li> create plane class containing array of cells
<li> create cell class

- un movable block cell    #
- movable block cell 
- kill cell 
- create/spawn cell 
- move forward cell 
- goal cell 
- cells that can be accessed by player 
- calls that can not 
- turn cell 


<li>console version <- default one  
<li>sdl version 

- animations ehhhhhh....

    well I wanted to avoid this step, but I guess there's no way i will 
- nice blocks png's 
<li> user input handling 
<li> level editor 
<li>opening / end screen

<li> bloom effect must have 
</ol>
