# block_o_automata
My* version of a automata game 

## the begginnign of the idea
So long time ago I 've seen a video of a guy writing game for some king of game jam,
anyway so he did an automata game that player sets up blocks and than he presses start and the game plays itself

kinda cool 

the guy made it in c# using unity
i'll try to find the original and link it below
